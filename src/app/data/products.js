    details: {
      general: `Protection from carbonation is absolutely essential not only to preserve and enhance life of concrete structures, but also to reduce future maintenance costs. Anti carbonation treatment is essential for all concrete structures such as buildings, driveways, roads, bridges, etc.
          
      Anti carbonation paint (Aliphatic Type) is a specially formulated coating/paint that provides protection against carbonation, chloride attack, and water permeability. It protects concrete against carbonation and salts such as chlorides and sulphates, and acts as a decorative as well as protective coating for concrete structures.`,
            carbonation: `A major factor in concrete decay is carbonation, caused by carbon dioxide (CO₂) reducing the alkalinity of concrete. This leads to corrosion of reinforcement and spalling. Sulphates and chlorides also accelerate degradation.
          
      Causes of decay in concrete:
      - Weathering leading to erosion
      - De-icing salts causing chloride corrosion
      - Water absorption leading to rusting of reinforcement
      - Insufficient concrete cover causing corrosion`,
            typicalUses: `Used in new and existing concrete and masonry structures requiring protection from water, CO₂, oxides of nitrogen, chlorides, sulphates, and UV radiation.
      Examples: car parks, industrial buildings, bridges, subways, high-rise flats, etc.`,

  pdf: "/pdfs/CUREX_AC.pdf",
  details: {
    general: `The strength and durability of concrete depend not only on the correct composition and placing of concrete but also on proper curing. The principal purpose of curing is to prevent evaporation of capillary water in concrete, ensuring complete hydration and improved strength. Traditional curing methods like spraying or covering with wet burlaps or polyethylene sheets are time-consuming and less efficient.

SHALIMAR’S KAVASSU CUREX (AC), a white pigmented curing compound, aids in reflection of UV rays and ensures complete coverage of the surface due to its white color. It is especially suitable for areas exposed to sunlight and wind, preventing shrinkage cracks and premature hardening.`,
    
    advantages: `• The spraying of SHALIMAR’S KAVASSU CUREX (AC) on freshly placed concrete is highly economical and prevents damage caused by rapid water loss.  
• The curing compound does not hinder adhesion of subsequent plaster or mortar.  
• The inherent characteristics of acrylic emulsion improve bonding.`,
    
    specificUsage: `• Areas where early plastering is expected  
• Concrete roads and bridges  
• Canal linings and other structures  
• Airport runways, motorways, harbors, and port piers  
• Dams and other irrigation-related structures  
• Roof decks, slabs, and retaining walls  
• Overhead repairs and inaccessible areas  
• Chimneys, cooling towers, and other tall structures`,
    
    dispensing: `SHALIMAR’S KAVASSU CUREX (AC) should be added directly into the mixing water before adding to wet concrete or into the mixer just before placement. It can also be added at batching plants or transit mixers. Overdosing may extend the setting time but will not affect final strength.`,
    
    application: `As a water-based compound, containers should be shaken well before use. Apply as soon as possible after the disappearance of surface water. Avoid applying on standing water or during bleed water stage. When applied on concrete within formworks, apply immediately after removal of forms by spraying or brushing.`,

  details: {
    description: `Kavassu Curex is a membrane-forming, ready-to-use white emulsion of specially blended synthetic waxes, complying with ASTM C 309-86.`,
    
    usage: `For application on freshly cast or newly exposed concrete surfaces after formwork removal, forming a temporary membrane to retain sufficient moisture for effective curing. The membrane eventually breaks down and disintegrates, allowing the surface to be painted. It is ideal for large concrete areas such as pavements, runways, bridge decks, and industrial floors, as well as vertical or sloped surfaces like chimneys, towers, silos, canal linings, columns, and beams where water curing is difficult or unreliable.
• Single application forms a moisture barrier for the entire curing period.  
• Eliminates the need for water, Hessian, or sand curing.  
• Prevents erratic or poor curing and ensures efficient cement hydration.  
• Increases strength, giving 12–15% higher strength than water-cured concrete.  
• Ensures hard-wearing surface, minimizing risk of shrinkage, cracks, and dusting.  
• Protects concrete against “burning” from solar radiation and harsh atmospheric exposure.  
• Easy and safe application — non-toxic and non-inflammable.  
• Eco-friendly formulation.`,
    
    scope: `Kavassu Curex is a versatile curing compound suitable for various construction conditions. Proper curing prevents loss of water from the surface, ensuring hydration, reduced shrinkage, and enhanced strength. Continuous water curing can be replaced by Kavassu Curex to save time, labor, and material while maintaining proper hydration and strength.`,
    
    application: `Apply Kavassu Curex immediately after the disappearance of surface water. Do not apply on standing water or bleeding surfaces. If concrete has dried out before application, lightly moisten the surface prior to use. The product forms a uniform film when applied as a single coat.`,
    
    applicationEquipment: `Use a low-pressure sprayer for uniform coverage. Maintain a spraying distance of approximately 1 meter to achieve consistent results. Stir the container well before use and ensure uniform coating. The compound can also be brushed or rolled as required. Avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight.`,

    howToSpecify: `Surfaces should be prepared in accordance with instructions for the use of SHALIMAR'S KAVASSU EP PRIMER. It should be mixed and applied strictly as per manufacturer’s recommendations.`,

    applicationAreas: `Machine base plates and crane-rail grouting.  
Anchoring of steel reinforcement, girders, and post-tensioned cables in concrete and stone.  
Joining precast concrete units, concrete-to-concrete, concrete-to-steel, and crack repair of structural concrete.`,

    surfacePreparation: `All surfaces must be cleaned thoroughly and contaminants removed using chemical or mechanical methods.  
All bolt pockets and under bases must be free from dust, laitance, and unsound substrate.  
If necessary, hack the substrate to provide extra mechanical key.`,

    mixing: `SHALIMAR'S KAVASSU EP PRIMER comprises two components — resin and hardener — supplied pre-weighed in correct proportions.  
Ease of mixing in cold weather is aided by storing tins in a warm atmosphere.  
For application, pour the hardener into the can containing the resin and drain well.  
Both components must be thoroughly mixed using a mechanical stirrer (e.g., electric drill with stirrer attachment) until a uniform clear liquid is obtained.  
Blend thoroughly until the primer has a uniform colour and consistency.`,

    application: `Apply the mixed material (primer) over the surface where any epoxy application is to be done.  
It serves as a base coat to enhance the adhesion of epoxy coatings to the substrate, whether galvanized steel, mild steel, or concrete.  
In pipe sections, pour the mixed primer from one side only, allowing it to rise to the required height on the opposite side.  
Ensure continuous pouring to prevent voids and discard any material once gel time begins.`,

    handlingPrecautions: `Cleanliness in handling epoxy resins is essential to prevent skin irritation.  
Gloves must be worn and goggles used to prevent eye contact.  
Any splashes on skin should be washed with water immediately and medical advice sought.`,

    storage: `SHALIMAR'S KAVASSU EP PRIMER may be stored for a year in manufacturer’s sealed containers under dry conditions and away from direct sunlight.`,

    fireSafety: `SHALIMAR'S KAVASSU EP PRIMER solutions are flammable.  
Do not expose to naked flames or ignition sources.  
No smoking at site or stockyard.  
Containers must be tightly sealed when not in use.  
In case of fire, extinguish with CO₂ or foam.`,

  pdf: "/pdfs/G50_L.pdf",
  details: {
    general: `SHALIMAR G-50 (L) is an integral waterproofing compound for concrete with good plasticizing properties. It does not contain any chloride and can also be used as an admixture for pre-stressed concrete. The admixture of SHALIMAR G-50 (L) in concrete brings about contraction of capillaries, rendering the concrete dense and waterproof. It is suitable for usage in production of waterproof concrete in accordance with DIN 1048 (German industrial standard No.1048) and similar relevant standards. It conforms with IS: 2645-2003.`,

    applications: `Addition of SHALIMAR G-50 (L) in the concrete mix allows a reduction of about 15% mixing water without affecting the workability of the mix.  
This property makes it possible to control and maintain the water–cement ratios as low as possible, which is critical in preparing watertight concrete.  
It brings about contraction of capillary pores and increases density, rendering the concrete optimally watertight.  
SHALIMAR G-50 (L) ensures uniform distribution of the binder, preventing segregation and bleeding, while producing a homogeneous cement gel that bonds aggregates effectively.  
Tests conducted as per DIN 1048 show significantly reduced water penetration and absorption, confirming its waterproofing efficiency.`,

    fieldsOfApplication: `SHALIMAR G-50 (L) is used for waterproof concretes in water-retaining structures, sanitary rooms, constructions exposed to humidity, concrete roofs, basements, tunnels, tanks, and swimming pools.`,

    instructionForUse: `SHALIMAR G-50 (L) should be mixed with gauging water or added to concrete during mixing. Mixing should continue for at least one minute after addition.  
The water quantity should be adjusted to account for water reduction due to the presence of SHALIMAR G-50 (L).`,
